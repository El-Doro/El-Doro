- 👋 Hi, I’m @El-Doro
- 💡 I’m interested in data analysis, vizualisation and trying out machine learning models to discover and experiment with these new technologies and active libraries.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow) and data engineering tools to expose model (FastAPI, Docker, Google Cloud, Heroku).
- 💞️ I'm currently working on projects involving audio (voice / music detection, bird song classification) but I’m also looking to contribute to open-source projects
to interract and discover the community.
- 📫 You can reach me by email p.ledore@gmail.com
